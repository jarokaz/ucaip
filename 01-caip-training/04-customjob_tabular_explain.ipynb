    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the AI Platform (Unified) Python SDK to train and deploy a custom tabular regression model for online prediction with explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this tutorial is the [Boston Housing Prices dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html). The version of the dataset you will use in this tutorial is built into Tensorflow. The trained model predicts the median price of a house in units of 1K USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to create a custom model from a Python script in a docker container using the AI Platform (Unified) SDK, and then do a prediction with explainability on the deployed model. You can alternatively create custom models from the command line using `gcloud` or online using Google Cloud Console.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps performed include: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create an AI Platform (Unified) custom job for training a model.\n",
    "- Train the model.\n",
    "- Retrieve and load the model (artifacts).\n",
    "- View the model evaluation.\n",
    "- Upload the model as a AI Platform (Unified) model.\n",
    "- Deploy the model to a serving endpoint.\n",
    "- Make a prediction with explanations.\n",
    "- Undeploy the model.\n",
