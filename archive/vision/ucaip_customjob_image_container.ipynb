    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this tutorial is the [cifar10 dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cifar10) from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview). The version of the dataset you will use is built into Tensorflow. The trained model predicts which type of class an image is from ten classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.\n",

    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to create a custom model from a Python script in a custom docker container using the AI Platform (Unified) SDK, and then do a prediction on the deployed model. You can alternatively create custom models from the command line using `gcloud` or online using Google Cloud Console.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps performed include: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a custom docker container for training.\n",
    "- Create an AI Platform (Unified) custom job for training a model.\n",
    "- Train the model using the custom container.\n",
    "- Retrieve and load the model (artifacts).\n",
    "- View the model evaluation.\n",
    "- Upload the model as a AI Platform (Unified) model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, you will upload your TF.Keras model from the custom job to AI Platform (Unified) model service, which will create a AI Platform (Unified) model resource for your custom model. During upload, you need to define a serving function to convert data to the format your model expects. If you send encoded data to AI Platform, your serving function ensures that the data is decoded on the model server before it is passed as input to your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the serving function work\n",
    "\n",
    "When you send a request to an online prediction server, the request is received by a HTTP server. The HTTP server\n",
    "extracts the prediction request from the HTTP request content body. The extracted prediction request is forwarded to the serving function. For Google pre-built prediction containers, the request content is passed to the serving function as a `tf.string`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The serving function consists of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `preprocessing function`:  \n",
    "  - Converts the input (`tf.string`) to the input shape and data type of the underlying model (dynamic graph).\n",
    "  - Performs the same preprocessing of the data that was done during training the underlying model -- e.g., normalizing, scaling, etc.\n",
    "- `post-processing function`:  \n",
    "  - Converts the model output to format expected by the receiving application -- e.q., compresses the output.\n",
    "  - Packages the output for the the receiving application -- e.g., add headings, make JSON object, etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Both the preprocessing and post-processing functions are converted to static graphs which are fused to the model. The output from the underlying model is passed to the post-processing function. The post-processing function passes the converted/packaged output back to the HTTP server. The HTTP server returns the output as the HTTP response content.\n",
    "\n",
    "One consideration you need to consider when building serving functions for TF.Keras models is that they run as static graphs. That means, you cannot use TF graph operations that require a dynamic graph. If you do, you will get an error during the compile of the serving function which will indicate that you are using an EagerTensor which is not supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Serving function for image data\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass images to the prediction service, you encode the compressed (e.g., JPEG) image bytes into base 64 -- which makes the content safe from modification while transmitting binary data over the network. Since this deployed model expects input data as raw (uncompressed) bytes, you need to ensure that the base 64 encoded data gets converted back to raw bytes before it is passed as input to the deployed model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this, define a serving function (`serving_fn`) and attach it to the model as a preprocessing step. Add a `@tf.function` decorator so the serving function is fused to the underlying model (instead of upstream on a CPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you send a prediction or explanation request, the content of the request is base 64 decoded into a Tensorflow string (`tf.string`), which is passed to the serving function (`serving_fn`). The serving function preprocesses the `tf.string` into raw (uncompressed) numpy bytes (`preprocess_fn`) to match the input requirements of the model:\n",
    "- `io.decode_jpeg`- Decompresses the JPG image which is returned as a Tensorflow tensor with three channels (RGB).\n",
    "- `image.convert_image_dtype` - Changes integer pixel values to float 32.\n",
    "- `image.resize` - Resizes the image to match the input shape for the model.\n",
    "- `resized / 255.0` - Rescales (normalization) the pixel data between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the data can be passed to the model (`m_call`)."
