These can be either individual python files or a zip (archive) of an entire package. In the later case, the job service will unzip (unarchive) the contents into the docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "-`python_module`: The python module (script) to invoke for running the custom training job. In this example, you will be invoking `trainer.task.py` -- note that it was not neccessary to append the `.py` suffix.\n",
    "\n",
    "-`args`: The command line arguments to pass to the corresponding pythom module. In this example, you will be:\n",

    "  - `\"--epochs=\" + EPOCHS`: The number of epochs for training.\n",
    "  - `\"--steps=\" + STEPS`: The number of steps (batches) per epoch.\n",
    "  - `\"--distribute=\" + TRAIN_STRATEGY\"` : The training distribution strategy to use for single or distributed training.\n",
    "     - `\"single\"`: single device.\n",
